📘 Excel Dashboard | Bank Loan Performance Analysis

Exploring loan data through Excel helped uncover key metrics like verification status, loan grades, and repayment patterns. Check out how I built a dashboard that visualizes credit trends over a decade.

Analyzed loan application data from 2007 to 2016, revealing trends in borrower behavior and credit status:
🔹 Total Loan Amount: ₹446M | Funded Amount: ₹435M
🔹 Average Interest Rate: 12.02%
🔹 Verification Split: 59% Verified, 41% Not Verified
🔹 Grade-wise Risk Profile: Grade B had the highest revol balance (30%)
🔹 Loan Type Trend: Mortgage ownership spiked in 2013–2015
🔹 State Performance: TX had the most charged-off loans by 2016

This Excel-based analysis helps in evaluating creditworthiness and improving loan risk strategy.

💳 Power BI Dashboard | Bank Loan Insights & Risk Assessment

What does loan data really reveal about borrower behavior? In this Power BI dashboard, I visualized loan performance over several years, uncovering trends in credit, risk factors, and repayment behaviors.

This dashboard helps visualize key risk and lending insights:
🔹 Loan Distribution (2007–2011): Sharp rise in 2010 (₹122M) and 2011 (₹261M)
🔹 Verification Accuracy: 58.88% of applicants verified
🔹 Grade B Revolving Balance: ₹40M (top performing segment)
🔹 NY & CA Loan Volumes: CA – 5823 current loans, NY – 3203
🔹 Subgrade Risk Analysis: Grades B1–B5 were top contributors in revol balance

Power BI brings these insights to life with drilldowns and visuals for real-time decision making.

📊 Tableau Dashboard | Bank Loan Insights & Risk Assessment
🔹 Key KPIs (Top Section)
Total Loan Amount: $446M
Total Funded Amount: $435M
Total Recoveries: 40K
Average Interest Rate: 12.02%

This indicates that the bank has disbursed a massive $446 million in loans, out of which $435 million was actually funded. The average interest rate on these loans is relatively high at 12.02%, which may reflect moderate to high risk across the portfolio. Recoveries (40K) highlight the bank's ability to reclaim defaulted amounts.

🟦 Summary:

🔹 Grade and Subgrade Wise Revolving Balance
This bar chart breaks down the revolving balance across loan grades and subgrades:
Top Subgrades with Highest Balances:
B1: $40M
B3: $38M
A4 & B5: Around $35–36M
Majority of the lending is concentrated in the B-grade category, signaling moderate credit risk tolerance.

🔹 Verified vs Non-Verified Status (Pie Chart)
Verified Applications: 58.88%
Not Verified: 41.12%
This suggests that nearly 60% of the applications underwent income or employment verification, which is a good indicator of risk mitigation practices.

🔹 Year-wise Loan Amount (Bar Chart)
2011: $261M
2010: $122M
2009: $46M
2008: $14M
2007: $2M
Loan disbursements grew exponentially from 2007 to 2011, peaking in 2011 with over 58% of the total loan amount disbursed that year.

🔹 Home Ownership vs Last Payment Date
This stacked bar chart shows borrower housing status over time:
2012–2014 had the highest number of payments.
Most payments came from borrowers with MORTGAGE status.
Peak count: ~4,754 in 2014 (MORTGAGE).
This implies that homeowners (especially those with mortgages) were the most active in loan repayments.

🔹 State-Wise & Year-Wise Loan Status (Treemap)
Top States by Loan Volume:
California (CA) and New York (NY) dominate, especially with "Fully Paid" statuses from 2014–2016.
California alone holds a large share in both successful repayments and charge-offs.
This map visually shows the performance of loans across regions and years, making it easy to identify strong and weak markets.

All dashboards deliver a comprehensive visual analysis of the bank's loan portfolio from 2007 to 2016. It effectively communicates:
Funding growth trends
Risk and grade distribution
Verification impact
Regional loan performance
Borrower profile via homeownership
