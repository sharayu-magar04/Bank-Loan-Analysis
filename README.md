ðŸ“˜ Excel Dashboard | Bank Loan Performance Analysis

Exploring loan data through Excel helped uncover key metrics like verification status, loan grades, and repayment patterns. Check out how I built a dashboard that visualizes credit trends over a decade.

Analyzed loan application data from 2007 to 2016, revealing trends in borrower behavior and credit status:

	â€¢ Total Loan Amount: â‚¹446M | Funded Amount: â‚¹435M
	â€¢ Average Interest Rate: 12.02%
	â€¢ Verification Split: 59% Verified, 41% Not Verified
	â€¢ Grade-wise Risk Profile: Grade B had the highest revol balance (30%)
	â€¢ Loan Type Trend: Mortgage ownership spiked in 2013â€“2015
	â€¢ State Performance: TX had the most charged-off loans by 2016

This Excel-based analysis helps in evaluating creditworthiness and improving loan risk strategy.

ðŸ’³ Power BI Dashboard | Bank Loan Insights & Risk Assessment

What does loan data really reveal about borrower behavior? In this Power BI dashboard, I visualized loan performance over several years, uncovering trends in credit, risk factors, and repayment behaviors.

This dashboard helps visualize key risk and lending insights:

	â€¢ Loan Distribution (2007â€“2011): Sharp rise in 2010 (â‚¹122M) and 2011 (â‚¹261M)
	â€¢ Verification Accuracy: 58.88% of applicants verified
	â€¢ Grade B Revolving Balance: â‚¹40M (top performing segment)
	â€¢ NY & CA Loan Volumes: CA â€“ 5823 current loans, NY â€“ 3203
	â€¢ Subgrade Risk Analysis: Grades B1â€“B5 were top contributors in revol balance

Power BI brings these insights to life with drilldowns and visuals for real-time decision making.

ðŸ“Š Tableau Dashboard | Bank Loan Insights & Risk Assessment

Key KPIs (Top Section):

	â€¢ Total Loan Amount: $446M
	â€¢ Total Funded Amount: $435M
	â€¢ Total Recoveries: 40K
	â€¢ Average Interest Rate: 12.02%

This indicates that the bank has disbursed a massive $446 million in loans, out of which $435 million was actually funded. The average interest rate on these loans is relatively high at 12.02%, which may reflect moderate to high risk across the portfolio. Recoveries (40K) highlight the bank's ability to reclaim defaulted amounts.

ðŸŸ¦ Summary:

ðŸ”¹ Grade and Subgrade Wise Revolving Balance

This bar chart breaks down the revolving balance across loan grades and subgrades:
Top Subgrades with Highest Balances:

	â€¢ B1: $40M
	â€¢ B3: $38M
	â€¢ A4 & B5: Around $35â€“36M
	
	Majority of the lending is concentrated in the B-grade category, signaling moderate credit risk tolerance.

ðŸ”¹ Verified vs Non-Verified Status (Pie Chart)

	â€¢ Verified Applications: 58.88%
	â€¢ Not Verified: 41.12%
	
This suggests that nearly 60% of the applications underwent income or employment verification, which is a good indicator of risk mitigation practices.

ðŸ”¹ Year-wise Loan Amount (Bar Chart)

	â€¢ 2011: $261M
	â€¢ 2010: $122M
	â€¢ 2009: $46M
	â€¢ 2008: $14M
	â€¢ 2007: $2M
	
Loan disbursements grew exponentially from 2007 to 2011, peaking in 2011 with over 58% of the total loan amount disbursed that year.

ðŸ”¹ Home Ownership vs Last Payment Date

This stacked bar chart shows borrower housing status over time:

	â€¢ 2012â€“2014 had the highest number of payments.
	â€¢ Most payments came from borrowers with MORTGAGE status.
	â€¢ Peak count: ~4,754 in 2014 (MORTGAGE).

This implies that homeowners (especially those with mortgages) were the most active in loan repayments.

ðŸ”¹ State-Wise & Year-Wise Loan Status (Treemap)

Top States by Loan Volume:

	â€¢ California (CA) and New York (NY) dominate, especially with "Fully Paid" statuses from 2014â€“2016.
	â€¢ California alone holds a large share in both successful repayments and charge-offs.

This map visually shows the performance of loans across regions and years, making it easy to identify strong and weak markets.

ðŸ”¹ All dashboards deliver a comprehensive visual analysis of the bank's loan portfolio from 2007 to 2016. 

It effectively communicates:

	â€¢ Funding growth trends
	â€¢ Risk and grade distribution
	â€¢ Verification impact
	â€¢ Regional loan performance
	â€¢ Borrower profile via homeownership
