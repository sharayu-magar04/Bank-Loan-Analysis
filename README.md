🏦 Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard Project:-

	• Tools Used: Excel, Power BI, Tableau
	• Domain: Banking & Financial Services | Lending | Data Analytics
	• Techniques: Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, KPI Calculation, Interactive Visualization

📁 Project Overview:-

This project is a comprehensive end-to-end analysis of a bank’s loan portfolio. Using tools like Excel, Power BI, and Tableau, I transformed raw loan data into meaningful insights that highlight loan performance, borrower behavior, risk segmentation, and regional lending trends. The dashboards created are designed to help stakeholders—such as credit analysts, risk officers, and management—make informed decisions based on data-driven metrics.

🎯 Business Objectives:-

	• Identify key trends in loan funding and repayment over time.
	• Understand risk distribution by loan grade and verification status.
	• Analyze borrower profiles based on ownership status and home state.
	• Evaluate product performance using interest rate and revolving balance metrics.
	• Visualize top-performing and high-risk states for better targeting.

📊 Key Insights and Analysis:-

✅ 1. Overall Lending Performance:

	• Total Loan Amount Disbursed: $446 Million
	• Total Amount Funded: $435 Million
	• Average Interest Rate Across Portfolio: 12.02%
	
This reflects the bank’s strong lending position with a relatively high funding-to-loan ratio, signaling operational efficiency.

🗓️ 2. Year-wise Loan Distribution:

	• The loan volume steadily increased from 2007 to 2011, with 2011 alone accounting for $261M in disbursed loans.
	• Indicates the bank’s expanding operations and increased customer acquisition over time.

📄 3. Verification Status Analysis:

	• 59% of the loans were verified, while 41% were not.
	• Verified loans have better performance and lower default rates, suggesting that verification correlates positively with reduced risk.

🏠 4. Ownership Type vs. Payment Trends:

	• Borrowers with mortgages and those renting are contributing the highest repayment volumes.
	• Borrowers who own their homes represent the smallest repayment segment—possibly due to lower borrowing needs or better financial standing.

🏅 5. Loan Grade and Sub-grade Breakdown:

	• Grades B and C dominate the loan portfolio, showing a focus on moderate-risk borrowers.
	• Subgrades B3 and B5 have the highest revolving balances, each over $35M, making them crucial segments for profitability and risk management.

📍 6. State-wise Loan Performance:

	• California (CA) leads the chart with the highest volume of loans, followed by New York (NY) and Texas (TX).
	• CA also sees the highest proportion of fully paid loans, indicating better financial discipline or successful loan management strategies.

📌 Summary:-

This project demonstrates the power of data visualization and analytics in the banking domain. I have applied key data analysis techniques including data cleaning, filtering, and summarization in Excel, and developed dynamic dashboards in both Power BI and Tableau.

Each platform provided unique benefits:

	• Excel: Data transformation, pivot tables, and KPI tracking.
	• Power BI: Interactive filters, dynamic visuals, and slicer-based exploration.
	• Tableau: High-level storytelling visuals, map-based insights, and performance comparison charts.
	
The outcome enables decision-makers to:

	• Detect performance trends.
	• Assess credit risk.
	• Target reliable borrower segments.
	• Improve operational and strategic decisions.

📎 What I Learned:-

	• How to work with large real-world financial datasets.
	• Practical dashboard building with industry-standard tools.
	• Connecting data insights with real business outcomes.
	• Communicating technical findings in a business-friendly way.
